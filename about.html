        This is a game where you have to get to school, but nothing seems to go your way. Everything is going against you and you are tasked with many challenges to get School.
        You will have to push boulders out the way, battle bosses, make new friends and problem solve through locked doors. You will be able to aquire money called pogs in order
        to purchase items to help you reach the end goal of getting to school.
